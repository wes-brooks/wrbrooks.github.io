I've recently bought an [RTL-SDR](rtl-sdr.com) dongle to play with as a software-defined radio. One of the first things I tried was to use it to receive HF weatherfax images from the US and Australian weather services.

Cleaning up the static just requires some filtering, a better antenna, and maybe some software tweaks.
