# Overview
I am going to be posting a series of active-learning exercises that I'm developing and using to teach an introductory statistics course.

# Background
This summer I am teaching an introduction to statistics course for engineers, which is my first experience leading a class on my own (I've TA'd and tutored in the past). Lecture notes were worked up by [Nick Keuler](http://www.silvis.forest.wisc.edu/people/Nicholas-Keuler) over few years of teaching this and similar statistics courses.

# The class
STAT 324 is a requirement for several engineering programs at the University of Wisconsin. I'm teaching an accelerated version during our eight-week summer session, which has four (75-minute) lectures and two discussion sections per week. Enrollment is 24 (it is summer session, after all). 

# Exercises
I'm adding small group exercises, aiming to come up with one for each class session. These are to be done in-class in groups of four in 15-20 minutes, with time for discussion afterward. Active participation is required - students get a participation point for working with their team on each exercise, and those points make up 20% of their grade.

I'll be posting each one to the blog after I give it to the students. Check back throughout the next two months!
