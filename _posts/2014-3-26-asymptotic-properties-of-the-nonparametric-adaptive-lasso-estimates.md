To show:

 - That the coefficients are consistent, and their rate of convergence ($n^{1/6}$?)
 - That the adaptive lasso estimates are consistent for selection and estimation, and that they obtain the oracle's rate of convergence.
 - That the same results are obtained for a GLM
 - That the adaptive group lasso obtains these results, too
 
Note: the coefficient estimates are biased proportionally to the second derivative of the coefficient function. This probably affects the oracle properties.
