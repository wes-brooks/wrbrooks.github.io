#Objective
We are learning about univariate descriptive plots and statistics: the histogram, box-and-whisker plot, mean, pecentiles, standard deviation. Additionally, we emphasize that plotting is the first step to understanding your data. The distinction between descriptive/inferential statistics is something we've talked about - the last question is supposed to inspire some critical thinking.

#Setup
I sampled 80 babies from the "Birth Weight II" data set at Deborah Nolan and Terry Speed's [Stat Labs website](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~statlabs/labs.html). For each baby, I wrote its gestation length (in days) on a [cheap white poker chip](http://www.amazon.com/Bag-Plastic-White-Poker-Chips/dp/B00K26W6DG). The chips were placed in one communal basket at the head of the class - each team sent a sampler and a recorder up to draw their sample. I assigned different sample sizes to each group (11, 15, or 19, to make quartiles easy).

#Exercise

## Sample your data
Your group has been assigned a sample size. From the central urn, draw your sample with replacement:

 1. Grab one chip from the urn
 2. Note the gestation length written on the chip and add it to your list. 
 3. Return the chip the the urn and repeat.


## Calculate summary statistics
Calculate the min, max, mean, median, first and third quartile, IQR, and standard deviation.


## Plot the data
Based on your sample, make a box-and-whisker plot of gestation period. Annotate it with the statistics you calculated in the previous step. How many of the samples were within one standard deviation of the mean? 


## Comment
Answer each of the following in about two sentences:

 - Describe one way in that your work is descriptive statistics.
 - Argue for why this is actually inferential statistics, and describe the population that your sample represents.
