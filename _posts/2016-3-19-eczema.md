In the daggerboard assembly post, one reason I gave for prefering PVA glue over epoxy where applicable was that epoxy aggravates my eczema. Ordinarily, the skin of my right hand looks totally normal. Here are a couple of photos, taken five days after I built bulkheads into the canoe hulls using epoxy fillets. I worked outside in order to minimize my exposure to fumes and wore vinyl gloves throughout.

I've dealt with eczema all my life, so I don't think this is an epoxy-sensitivity reaction like you hear about from repeated overexposure. This rash will clear up by itself in a few more days, and it only hurts/itches for the first day or two. But still, I'd prefer to avoid it.
