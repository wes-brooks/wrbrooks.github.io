# Local variable selection for nonparametric spatial varying coefficient models (NPSVCR)

Theory:

 - GLMs estimated by kernel smoothing are consistent, and show the asymptotic distribution of the coefficients
 - Adaptive group lasso (AGL) is consistent in selection for NPSVCR models of gaussian response data
 - Calculate the asymptotic distribution of coefficients in NPSVCR model with gaussian response
 - Adaptive group lasso is consistent in selection for NPSVCR models of exponential family response data
 - Calculate the asymptotic distribution of coefficients in NPSVCR model with exponential family response
 - Selecting AGL tuning parameter by AICc preserves optimality
 - Selecting bandwudth by AICc preserves optimality
 - Confidence intervals via bootstrap, AICc bw-likelihood profile

Applications:

 - Simulations (gaussian response)
 - Simulations (binomial response)
 - Simulations (poisson response)
 - Poverty data
 - mountain pine beetle
 - N. Wisconsin land use
 
Coding:

 - AGL for binomial data
 - AGL for poisson data
 - AGL for survival data (Cox model, AFT model)
 - Confidence intervals via bootstrap, AICc bw-likelihood profile
