## Statement of theorem 3:

Under the assumptions of theorem 1, if $nh\_1^6 = O(1)$ and $h/h\_1 \to 0$, then

$$\sqrt{n h\_1^2 f(s)} \left( \hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}(s) - \boldsymbol{\beta}(s) - 2^{-1} \kappa\_0^{-1} \kappa\_2 h\_1^2 \{ \boldsymbol{\beta}\_{uu}(s) + \boldsymbol{\beta}\_{vv}(s) \} \right)  \xrightarrow{D} N\left( \boldsymbol{0}, \kappa\_0^2 \nu\_0 \sigma^2 \Xi^{-1} \right)$$

for any given $s$.
