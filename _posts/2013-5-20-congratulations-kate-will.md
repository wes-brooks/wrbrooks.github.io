I was in Milwaukee twice this weekend, each time to celebrate an awesome accomplishment by someone close to me. On Friday, Kate won the gold and silver awards for best "Innovative Feature" from the Milwaukee Press Club for her [Governor Walker calendar files project](http://www.wisconsinwatch.org/the-walker-calendar-files-overview/) and [brownfields](http://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2012/09/23/map-brownfields-nationwide/) projects. In all, her [Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism](http://www.wisconsinwatch.org) won eight awards this year.

Two days later, we went back to celebrate the my cousin Will Massey, who got his doctorate in Kinesiology from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. While putting this post together, I also learned that he was the graduate school's [featured student in November 2012](http://www.graduateschool.uwm.edu/students/featured/william-massey/).

Congratulations, both of you!
