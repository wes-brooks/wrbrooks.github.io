Hola amigos, it's been a while since I rapped at ya. Your square amigo is out there riding those untamed currents. Anyway, I've got a boatbuilding update for you. For one, the tarp I use to cover the canoes when it rains was getting kinda threadbare so I slapped on a coat of primer to protect the hulls from the sun and rain. I don't think these will end up white but who can say? Mrs. Somesquares and I are brainstorming names and thinking about a launch date in the month of May.

The full bulkheads are in, the centerboard cases have been attached  the accompanying holes cut in the bottoms (always a fraught moment!)

One thing about the way the Quick Canoe is designed: using epoxy fillets saves a ton o time over measuring and cutting out stringers for a more traditional construction. Making eight semi-frames for each boat, measuring, cutting out, and gluing the stringers seemed to take *forever*. Now they're complete and going into the hulls. These photos show the first five, which I've just glued in place.

Once all these semi-frames are in place, I have a stringer that goes between bulkheads three and four (touching the top corner of each semi-frame). Together with a top deck and a side deck, these will create sealed flotation along each side of the cockpit, as well as stiffening the boat. Here is another perspective:
