It wasn't until this past weekend that I finally made the year's first visit to my plot at the Eagle Heights Community Garden. As expected, things had gotten out of hand:

And I'd been served with notice of a weedy plot, which means I had to clear it or lose it. I'd like to hang on to the garden, if only because I have some awesome perennials (hops and raspberries!) that keep coming back no matter how terrible I am at gardening. So I spent Saturday and Sunday in the garden and eventually got the situation under control:
