#Objective
This was the exercise for our first class session. It's intended to be a gentle introduction to the exercise format and to emphasize that the first things to do with data are to make exploratory plots and compute some summary statistics.

#Setup
This exercise began by me polling the class and listing everyone's anonymized sex and height (in inches) on the blackboard.

#Exercise

## Make a plot
I will have written everyone's height and gender on the board. Plot the data on two separate number lines, one for men and one for women.


## Annotate the plot
Annotate the plot with two details that you think are important. These should be numerical details that can summarize something about the data.
