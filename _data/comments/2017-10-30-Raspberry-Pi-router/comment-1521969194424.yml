  Sorry for the double commend. So i managed to make it work by only using
  addresses in range of 10.0.0.x in both dhcpcd.conf (for static IP address) and
  dnsmasq.conf for the range addresses. Also in dhcpcd.conf i put as static
  routers = my-default-gateway. I dont know if this what i was suppose to do but
  just to let everyone know in case they have a similar issue. Overall great
  tutorial thanks.
