  I am a total newbie to Raspberry PI 3 etc. but what I want it to do is receive
  a wifi signal and then feed it to another wifi modem to feed my workshop. is
  this the setup I need. or can I even do it., I have a spare wifi router just
  need to get a signal to it to broadcast. I will be using an external range
  extender antenna on the raspberry.
