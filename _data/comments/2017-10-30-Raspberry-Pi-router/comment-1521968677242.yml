  It doesn't seem to work so just to clarify things. In my home network i have
  192.168.10.x addresses in which 192.168.10.254 is my default gateway. Now when
  i configure my raspberry wlan0 IP address to 192.168.1.1 address it fails to
  show up the AP to connect. When i put an address that is in range of my
  network (e.g 192.168.10.1) the AP shows up correctly but when i connect a
  device to it i don't have internet access. Now in the dnsmasq.conf i tried
  having addresses in range of 192.168.10.x and 192.168.1.x but none of them
  work. From my raspberry that acts as router i can ping my home default
  gateway. So i cant figure out what the issue might be. (i check all the cables
  are connected and working correctly).
