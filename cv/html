Wesley Brooks
=============

I'm a number-crunching bicyclist gardener Alaskan sailor who's ABD in
Wisconsin and looking to return to the Pacific Northwest.

I care about technology, the environment, human welfare and happiness
(the order changes daily!) My current research focus is nonparametric
spatial statistics and local modeling - for instance: what factors are
predictors of the poverty rate for a given county in the state of
Wisconsin, and are those factors different from other parts of the state
and country?

Statistics is special because of its focus on inference and observation.
How do we know that we know what we know? That's statistics. Also: what
do we not know? And which is more important to predicting the
consequences of our actions?

I'm passionate about reproducible research, design, and communicating
effectively through visualizations.
